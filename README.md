<b>Introduction</b><br>
The latest year of data was downloaded from the OOI of Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring and Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring [1]. The bulk meterology instrument package was selected. The bulk meterology instrument package characterizes weather conditions above the sea surface. Wind speed and rain rate were analyzed over the course of a year for the two locations. 

Problem 1) For each site, plot wind speed (in m/s) and rain rate (in mm/hr) Find these time windows: when it is windy and rainy, when it is rainy but not windy, when it is windy but not rainy, when it is not windy not rainy. Show each time period on 
your plot (for example, use different colors and have a legend to show which region each color represents)

Problem 2) Plot the cross-correlation function between wind speed at both sites. What is the highest correlation? What is the time lag?

Problem 3) Plot the cross-correlation function between rain at both sites. What is the highest correlation? What is the time lag?

Problem 4) Is there any relationship between the time lag of wind speed and rain rate? 

Problem 5) In another plot, calculate and plot the monthly average of the wind speed and rain rate
for each site
What pattern do you see? Explain.
Which month had the highest rain rate? 
Which month had the lowest rain rate?
Which month had the highest wind speed?
Which month had the lowest wind speed?
